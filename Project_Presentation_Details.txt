TEXTILE MILL MONITORING SYSTEM - PROJECT DETAILS
================================================================================

1. ABSTRACT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Textile Mill Monitoring System is a comprehensive, real-time analytics platform designed to optimize production efficiency and mitigate supply chain risks in textile manufacturing. By leveraging synthetic data streams and machine learning, the system provides actionable insights into machine performance and supplier reliability.

The core of the project is a premium, dark-themed interactive dashboard built with Streamlit. It integrates real-time data ingestion for production metrics (speed, temperature, output) and supplier logistics (delivery delays). The system utilizes a cloud-based Supabase backend for scalable data storage and employs advanced machine learning models (XGBoost) to predict potential downtime and assess supply risks. Key features include live KPI monitoring, automated risk alerts, and a detailed model evaluation matrix, empowering decision-makers with data-driven tools to enhance operational stability.

3. MODULE DESCRIPTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MODULE 1: DATA INGESTION & SIMULATION LAYER
   - Purpose: Simulates a live production environment.
   - Components:
     * machine_stream.py: continually generates synthetic telemetry for textile machines (RPM, temperature, output).
     * supplier_stream.py: generates synthetic supplier order and delivery usage data.
     * simulate_all.py: Orchestrator script to manage concurrent execution of all data streams.

MODULE 2: BACKEND & STORAGE LAYER
   - Purpose: Secure, scalable data persistence.
   - Components:
     * Supabase (Cloud Postgres): Central repository for `production_data` and `supplier_data`.
     * config.py: Manages secure connection credentials and environment variables.

MODULE 3: ANALYTICS & MACHINE LEARNING ENGINE
   - Purpose: Transforms raw data into predictive insights.
   - Components:
     * data_processing.py: Cleans, aggregates, and transforms raw stream data.
     * model_inference.py: Deployed ML models (XGBoost) to predict machine failure risks and supplier delays.
     * Evaluation Matrix: A dedicated module for monitoring model accuracy (Confusion Matrix, Precision/Recall).

MODULE 4: EXECUTIVE DASHBOARD (UI)
   - Purpose: Visualization and User Interaction.
   - Components:
     * dashboard.py: The main application entry point.
     * Live Monitoring: Auto-refreshing interface updating every 3 seconds.
     * Visualizations:
       - Real-time Efficiency Gauges (Plotly).
       - Risk Analysis Bar Charts.
       - Interactive Data Grids.
     * UX Design: Custom CSS implementation for "Glassmorphism" aesthetic, dark mode, and responsive layout.
