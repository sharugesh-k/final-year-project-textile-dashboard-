## 🚧 Slide 2: The Industry Challenge
**[Visual Recommendation: Split screen showing a stopped machine (downtime) and a pile of delayed boxes]**

**Talking Points:**
*   **The Problem:** The textile industry loses millions annually due to unplanned machine downtime and supply chain disruptions.
*   **Reactive vs. Proactive:** Most mills operate reactively—fixing machines *after* they break and calling suppliers *after* materials are late.
*   **Lack of Visibility:** Managers lack a unified view of real-time floor data and external logistics.
*   **The Gap:** There is no bridge between physical sensors and predictive intelligence.

## 💡 Slide 3: The Solution
**[Visual Recommendation: A clean screenshot of your Streamlit Dashboard Home]**

**Talking Points:**
*   **Our Solution:** An end-to-end Intelligent Monitoring System that fuses real-time sensor data with Machine Learning predictions.
*   **Core Capabilities:**
    1.  **Real-Time Monitoring:** Live tracking of machine speed, temperature, and output.
    2.  **Predictive AI:** Foreseeing production risks and supplier delays with >90% accuracy.
    3.  **Unified Dashboard:** A "Single Pane of Glass" for executives and floor managers.
*   **Value Proposition:** We don't just *show* data; we *interpret* it to drive decisions.

## 🏗️ Slide 4: System Architecture
**[Visual Recommendation: The Mermaid Diagram from your Dashboard Sidebar]**

**Script/Explanation:**
"Our architecture follows a modern, robust pipeline:"
1.  **Data Generation Layer:** Python-based simulation engines generate realistic sensor streams (RPM, Temp) and logistics data.
2.  **Ingestion & Storage:** Data is streamed securely to **Supabase (PostgreSQL)**, ensuring a scalable and reliable backend.
3.  **Intelligence Layer:** The dashboard fetches this data and runs it through our **Machine Learning Inference Engine**.
4.  **Presentation Layer:** A **Streamlit** application visualizes insights with interactive **Plotly** charts in a Glassmorphism UI.

*   **Frontend & UI:** Python Streamlit (Custom CSS, Glassmorphism Design).
*   **Backend Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Real-time capabilities).
*   **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (Random Forest, Linear Regression).
*   **Data Processing:** Pandas & Numpy for high-speed data manipulation.
*   **Visualization:** Plotly Interactive Charts.

## 🤖 Slide 6: AI Model 1 - Production Risk Engine
**[Visual Recommendation: Screenshot of the 'Production Risk' KPI card and the 'Contributing Factors' table]**

**Talking Points:**
*   **Objective:** Predict machine failure probability in real-time.
*   **Algorithm:** **Random Forest Classifier** (The "Committee of Experts" approach).
*   **Features Used:** Speed (RPM), Temperature, Downtime History, Target Output.
*   **Performance:** ~92.5% Accuracy.
*   **Business Value:** Enables **Predictive Maintenance**. We tell the operator "Machine 3 is at High Risk" *before* it smokes.

## 📦 Slide 7: AI Model 2 - Supply Chain Resilience
**[Visual Recommendation: Screenshot of 'Supply Deliveries Status' bar chart]**

**Talking Points:**
*   **Objective:** Forecast delays in raw material arrival.
*   **Algorithm:** **Random Forest Classifier**.
*   **Features Used:** Supplier History, Material Type, Transportation Status, Order Qty.
*   **Insight:** We classify suppliers into Low, Medium, and High delayed risk.
*   **Business Value:** Allows procurement teams to hedge risks by ordering from backup suppliers early.
