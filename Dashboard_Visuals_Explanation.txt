DASHBOARD VISUALS & ML MODEL EXPLANATION
================================================================================

This document explains the visual elements of the Textile Mill Command Center dashboard, 
specifically focusing on the KPI Cards, the Speedometer (Gauge) Graph, and how the 
Machine Learning (ML) models connect to these visuals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. KPI CARDS (TOP ROW)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The top row contains 5 Key Performance Indicator (KPI) cards that provide an 
instant snapshot of the mill's health.

1. **Current Efficiency**
   - **What it is:** The percentage of actual production vs. the target.
   - **Calculation:** (Actual Output / Target Output) * 100.
   - **Example:** If Target is 100 units and Actual is 92 units, Efficiency is 92.0%.
   - **Model Connection:** Not a direct model prediction; this is real-time calculated data.

2. **🤖 ML Risk Score**
   - **What it is:** The probability that the production line will face downtime or failure.
   - **Model Used:** **Random Forest Classifier (Production Risk Model)**.
   - **Example:** A score of "85%" means the AI is 85% certain there is a high risk of failure based on current speed, temperature, and downtime patterns.
   - **Visual Cue:** Turns RED if risk is High/Critical.

3. **Supply Delay Risk**
   - **What it is:** The probability that incoming raw material supplies will be delayed.
   - **Model Used:** **Random Forest Classifier (Supplier Delay Model)**.
   - **Example:** A score of "12%" indicates Low Risk, meaning supplies are likely to arrive on time.
   - **Visual Cue:** Turns RED if risk is High.

4. **Avg Output/Cycle**
   - **What it is:** The average number of units produced per machine cycle in the current session.
   - **Data Source:** Real-time average of the 'actual_output' data stream.

5. **📦 Total Output**
   - **What it is:** The total number of units produced in the current monitored session (or last X hours).
   - **Data Source:** Sum of 'actual_output'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. SPEEDOMETER GRAPH (GAUGE CHART)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Located in the "Live Machine Performance" section (right side).

- **Visual Name:** Plant Efficiency Gauge.
- **What it Represents:** The overall operational efficiency of the entire plant.
- **Data Source:** Real-time calculation ((Total Actual / Total Target) * 100).
- **Color Coding:**
  - **Green:** 90% - 100% (Excellent Performance)
  - **Grey:** 80% - 90% (Acceptable)
  - **Red:** 0% - 80% (Underperforming/Critical)
- **Model Connection:** While this displays *actual* current efficiency, the **Linear Regression Model** (described below) is trained to *predict* this value based on machine settings, helping managers understand what efficiency *should* be.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. WHICH MODELS REPRESENT WHICH GRAPHS?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### A. Production Risk Model (Random Forest Classifier)
This model analyzes machine sensors (Speed, Temperature, Downtime) to predict failure.
- **Visual Representation:**
  1. **KPI Card:** "🤖 ML Risk Score" (Top Row).
  2. **Table:** "Risk Contributing Factors" (Bottom Left).
     - *Example:* Shows "Temperature Impact: 35% impact" if high heat is the main reason for the risk.

### B. Supplier Delay Model (Random Forest Classifier)
This model analyzes supplier data (Order Qty, Material Type, Logistics) to predict lateness.
- **Visual Representation:**
  1. **KPI Card:** "Supply Delay Risk" (Top Row).
  2. **Bar Chart:** "Delay Risk by Supplier" (Bottom Right).
     - *Example:* A bar chart showing Supplier A has a high red bar (High Risk) while Supplier B has a low bar.

### C. Efficiency Prediction Model (Linear Regression)
This model predicts what the efficiency *should* be given the current machine parameters.
- **Visual Representation:**
  1. **Tab Section:** "Model Evaluation" -> "Efficiency Prediction Model".
  2. **Metrics:** R² Score, RMSE (displayed in the model details section).
  3. **Context:** It provides the benchmark against which the **Speedometer Gauge** is evaluated.
