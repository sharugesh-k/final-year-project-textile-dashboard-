# Dashboard Enhancement Walkthrough

I have successfully enhanced the dashboard with a premium dark UI, real-time data integration, and advanced management KPIs.

## Changes Verified

### 1. **Premium UI Overhaul**
- **Dark Theme**: Implemented a professional dark mode (`#0e1117` background).
- **Glassmorphism**: Added translucent, blurred cards for metrics and data grids for a modern look.
- **Plotly Integration**: Replaced standard charts with interactive, dark-themed Plotly graphs.

### 2. **New Management Metrics**
- **KPI Cards**: Added top-level metrics for *Efficiency*, *Predicted Downtime Risk*, and *ML Accuracy*.
- **Advanced Charts**:
    - **Live Efficiency Gauge**: A real-time speedometer style gauge for plant efficiency.
    - **Supply Risk Analysis**: Use color-coded bars to instantly see delayed shipments.
    - **Model Evaluation API**: New tab with Confusion Matrix, Prediction Distribution Pie Chart, and XGBoost Accuracy.

### 3. **Real-time Automation**
- **Simulation Script**: Created `simulate_all.py` to run both machine and supplier data streams simultaneously.
- **Auto-Refresh**: Added a "Live Monitoring" toggle in the dashboard to automatically update charts every 3 seconds.

## How to Run

1.  **Start the Data Simulation** (Terminal 1)
    ```bash
    python simulate_all.py
    ```
    *Leave this running to generate live data.*

2.  **Launch the Dashboard** (Terminal 2)
    ```bash
    streamlit run dashboard.py
    ```

3.  **Experience Live Mode**
    - Open the dashboard in your browser.
    - Toggle on **🔴 Live Monitoring** at the top left.
    - Watch the charts and KPIs update in real-time as the simulation runs!
